       "\"In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best large cap value ETFs. If you want to jump to the top five ETFs and skip out the details about large cap companies, then check out 5 Best Large-Cap Value ETFs.\\n\\nLarge cap stocks are some of the most widely traded on the market. Even though mega cap firms take the most attention in the media, large caps are important companies that often have thousands of employees and numerous suppliers that depend on them for a stable flow of orders. Additionally, their business footprint is also greater than other stocks such as mid cap stocks and small cap stocks. Consequently,\\xa0 these firms can also have an international presence, which provides both benefits and drawbacks when the viability of an investment decision is considered.\\n\\nThese stocks are also more resilient to adverse economic conditions, as their shares, depending on the business model of the firm, are often viewed as a source of stability. Large cap stocks often have adequate cash reserves that enable them to keep the business functional even as revenue drops, leaving them better off in a weak economy when compared to small cap firms which are typically less resilient. However, the higher share prices, and the fact that the stocks post lower losses, also limit their growth in an economic recovery which is typically a time of optimism that sees major stock indexes rise in their value.\\n\\nRight now, investor attention in the stock market is focused on a mix of local and international factors. America has led the world when it comes to economic robustness, and news from China suggests that the economy might be starting to recover as the Communist Party steps into action and introduces reforms to stimulate activity. The second half of 2023 has seen the U.S. dollar erase all losses that it posted after the banking crisis in March, and a strong reason behind this appreciation has been weak global economic data that has brought back risk aversion to investors' minds.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAt the same time, a rise in global oil prices in the wake of supply cuts is also generating fears that global central banks, including the Federal Reserve, will be forced to keep a close eye on inflation readings for longer. Purchaser, or upstream supply chain prices, are on the rise in the U.S., and their effects on the broader consumer price index can lead to either high interest rates for longer or even additional rate hikes depending on what the data shows.\\n\\nThe strength of large cap stocks and their robust and viable business models are apparent when we consider the stocks that are part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The Dow is one of the oldest stock market indexes in the market, and its constituents, which are typically limited to 30 companies, are called blue chip stocks. This title is an allusion to their value and 15 out of the 30 companies part of the DJIA can be considered large cap stocks 'proper'. There are two ways to classify a large cap stock, and one definition narrows down the market capitalization to sit between $10 billion and $200 billion, while the other classifies any company with a market capitalization greater than $10 billion as a large cap stock.\\n\\nWithin a broader investment framework, the concept of value is quite popular in the industry and among investors. A value stock is one that is believed to be trading at less than what its fundamentals would indicate. These stocks attract investors due to the potential of a share price appreciation since the underlying business model is capable of growing its market share and revenue in the future. There are several metrics that measure a stock's value. Two of these are the price to earnings and price to sales ratios. They compared the share price of a firm with its ability to generate sales or generate profit and we've extensively covered both of these.

And if you want to learn about value stocks irrespective of their market capitalization, then take a look at 10 Oversold Value Stocks To Buy.\\n\\nToday, we'll look at some exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in large cap and value stocks.
